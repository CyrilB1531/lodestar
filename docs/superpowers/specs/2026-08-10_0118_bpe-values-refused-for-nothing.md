# 0118 — The BPE values the loader refuses for nothing, and the one that crashes `Decode`

**Issue:** [#118](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/118) · **Umbrella:** [#105](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/105) · **Date:** 2026-08-10 · **Status:** written before the work

## Context

`TokenizerJsonLoader.LoadBpe` refuses five things a real `tokenizer.json` can declare. #105 was split into
six lots on 2026-08-10; this is the first, and the only one that designs no new behaviour. Every item here
is a value that is representable in a real file and that this library either rejects for no reason or
accepts and then crashes on.

All four were verified against `main` at 38813b0 rather than carried over from #105's text, which a previous
session wrote and which `main` has moved under since.

| Claim | Where it was checked |
| --- | --- |
| `end_of_word_suffix: ""` crashes `Decode` | `BpeTokenizer.cs:718-720` guards only `is null`; `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:551` assigns the empty string as-is |
| `continuing_subword_prefix: ""` is refused | `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:585` matches `is { } prefix`, which an empty string satisfies |
| `dropout: 0.0` is refused | `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:597` refuses any non-null value without reading it |
| `add_prefix_space` defaults disagree | `?? true` at `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:756`, `?? false` at `:797` |

## Decisions

### D1 — an empty end-of-word suffix is no suffix, and the rule lives on the type

`BpeVocabulary.EndOfWordSuffix`'s `init` accessor maps `""` to `null`. `Equals` and `GetHashCode` are
untouched: they already compare the stored value, which becomes canonical.

The rule goes on the type rather than in the loader because `BpeVocabulary` is public and constructible.
`new BpeVocabulary { EndOfWordSuffix = "" }` reaches `StringBuilder.Replace("", " ")` without the loader
ever running, so a loader-side fix would leave half the defect in place — and would make a loaded
vocabulary and a hand-built one with the same meaning compare unequal. That is the failure ADR 0022 §4
records for `AddedToken.Normalized`, where the default was first written in the loader and had to be moved
onto the type. This is the same shape, and it gets the same answer without paying for the discovery twice.

### D2 — the two refusals become conditional, and only the condition changes

`continuing_subword_prefix: ""` and `dropout: 0.0` stop being refused. The readers are untouched:
`OptionalString` still returns `""` for an empty JSON string, and the refusal messages for a non-empty
prefix and a non-zero dropout stay word for word, because they are still right.

A non-empty prefix stays refused — it is [#120](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/120)'s
subject. Whether dropout above zero is ever reproduced stays open — it is
[#123](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/123)'s decision. This lot only removes the two values
that provably change nothing.

### D3 — a `ByteLevel` block that omits `add_prefix_space` is refused, in all three positions

**This decision replaces the one first written here, which the measurement refuted.** The original D3 said
`?? false` at `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:797` should become `?? true`, "matching HuggingFace's `ByteLevel`
default". There is no such default. Measured on `tokenizers` 0.23.1:

| Shape | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `ByteLevel` omitting `add_prefix_space`, top-level `pre_tokenizer` | refused — `missing field 'add_prefix_space'` |
| the same, inside a `Sequence` | refused, identically |
| the same, in the `decoder` slot | refused — worded through the untagged enum, same cause |
| `ByteLevel` omitting `trim_offsets` | refused, both positions |
| `ByteLevel` omitting `use_regex` | **accepted**, `to_str()` writes `true` back |

So the rule is **per field**: `use_regex` carries a serde default, `add_prefix_space` and `trim_offsets` do
not. The comment at `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:741` — "`use_regex` defaults to `true` and stock GPT-2 omits
it" — is correct and stands. A refusal written from the broader reading, that no `ByteLevel` field has a
default, would have refused stock GPT-2.

Both of this library's readers are therefore more permissive than the reference. `LoadBpe` will refuse a
`ByteLevel` block that omits `add_prefix_space`, naming the field, wherever it appears — top-level
`pre_tokenizer`, a `Sequence` step, or the `decoder`. The `?? true` at `:756` and the `?? false` at `:797`
both disappear: with the omission refused, neither default can be reached.

`trim_offsets` stays tolerated when omitted, deliberately. This library does not read it — no offsets are
exposed — so its absence changes nothing that is computed here, and refusing on it would be a rule no
behavioural test could justify. The asymmetry is the point: the refusal exists where a missing field would
force this library to **invent** a value that changes its output, and `add_prefix_space` is the only such
field.

Existing tests or fixtures that build a `ByteLevel` block without `add_prefix_space` encode the old
permissiveness. They are updated to declare it — a file omitting it is one the reference would not load.

### D4 — the public `ContinuingSubwordPrefix` property is not touched here

It is public, participates in `Equals` and `GetHashCode`, and `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:552` deliberately
does not carry it, with a comment saying so. Giving it D1's treatment would be symmetric, but
[#120](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/120) may delete the property outright, and churning it
twice is worse than leaving it consistent with itself for one release cycle. Recorded here so a reviewer
asking "why one and not the other" finds the answer instead of the omission.

## The measurement, and what it returned

This section was written as an open question — whether `tokenizers` 0.23.1 accepts `end_of_word_suffix: ""`
and what it does with it — with three outcomes named because they are three different changes. It was
measured before any code was written, and the answers are recorded here rather than left in a report.

- **`end_of_word_suffix: ""`** — accepted at construction, declared back by `to_str()` as the literal `""`
  rather than as null, survives a `from_str()` round trip unchanged, and encodes **identically** to a
  model built without it. That is outcome 1: D1 is parity, a corpus case can exist, and no ADR is due.
- **`continuing_subword_prefix: ""`** and **`dropout: 0.0`** — both accepted, both reproducing the
  baseline token stream exactly, both round-tripping with the value they were given.
- **`add_prefix_space` omitted** — the answer nobody expected, and the one that rewrote D3. See D3 above.

The general lesson is worth keeping, because this is the third statement in this issue's lineage that
measurement has overturned: the `special`/`normalized` rule in #104, `add_prefix_space` here, and — nearly —
`use_regex`, where an over-broad reading of the measurement would have refused stock GPT-2 had the
repository's own comment not contradicted it. Probe first, implement second, and check a generalisation
against the claims already in the tree.

## Evidence

Two of the four items — the empty prefix and the zero dropout — are the *absence* of a refusal, and a test
that loads a file without throwing proves only that nothing was thrown. It does not prove the value is a
no-op.

- **The crash:** a unit test that `EndOfWordSuffix = ""` reads back as `null` and compares equal to a
  vocabulary built with `null`, plus a `Decode` on the classic lineage that raised `ArgumentException`
  before. Neither depends on an oracle.
- **The two no-op values:** an oracle case showing `tokenizers` produces the same tokens with the value
  declared as with the setting absent. That is the assertion that carries the claim; a load test is a
  by-product.
- **The `add_prefix_space` refusal:** a loader test per position — top-level, `Sequence` step, `decoder` —
  asserting the exception names the field, plus a test that a block declaring it still loads and encodes as
  before. The corpus records what `tokenizers` does with each shape, including the refusals, so the parity
  claim rests on the reference rather than on this spec's word.

New corpora go in `tools/generate_oracles.py`, following `generate_bpe_added_token_flags`'s shape — it
records `tokenizer.to_str()` in its metadata, so the C# side parses the exact bytes HuggingFace was handed.
Not `tools/build_tiny_models.py`, which holds frozen fixtures that carry no reference values.

Generation runs from a neutral working directory, or `nltk` refuses to import its dependencies; and the
generator's own exit code is read, never a pipeline's.

## Documentation

- `docs/equivalence.md`'s `LoadBpe` row enumerates eleven refusals in prose, each verified against the code
  during #104. Two become conditional: a non-empty prefix, a non-zero dropout.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: the plan must first establish **whether the crash exists in a published version**. 0.2.0
  shipped; if the classic lineage and `end_of_word_suffix` were in it, the entry goes under *Fixed* and
  concerns real users, which is a different statement from a defect that never shipped. That is a
  `git tag` and `Version.props` check, not a recollection.
- `docs/guides/embeddings.md` enumerates refusals too. Check it by `grep` rather than from memory — counts
  and enumerations going stale silently is the failure mode #104 hit twice.
- No ADR, unless the probe returns outcome 2 above.

## Out of scope

`fuse_unk` ([#119](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/119)), a non-empty
`continuing_subword_prefix` and the public property ([#120](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/120)),
the BPE normalizer ([#121](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/121)), `use_regex: false` and the
per-piece prefix-space rule ([#122](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/122)), and the dropout
decision ([#123](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/123)). `byte_fallback` stays refused for
ADR 0017 §3's reason and belongs to no lot.

## Risks

- **D3 is now a new refusal, not a corrected default.** Files that load today stop loading. No file the
  reference would accept is affected — that is the whole argument — but hand-written fixtures inside this
  repository may omit the field, and each one that does has to be fixed rather than exempted. The
  CHANGELOG must say a refusal was added, in the section a consumer reads for breaking changes.
- **`Equals` is public behaviour.** D1 makes two vocabularies that compare unequal today compare equal
  tomorrow. Nothing in the repository depends on the old answer, but the CHANGELOG should say so.
- **None of the four appears in any shipped model or committed corpus**, so no existing corpus can catch a
  mistake in them by regressing. The fixtures built for the purpose are the only guard, which is why they
  must assert token streams rather than load success.
