# 0134 — Comments: what they may claim, and how long they may be

**Issue:** [#134](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/data.net/issues/134) · **Date:** 2026-08-14 · **Status:** written before the work

## Context

This repository's comments carry unusual weight. A comment saying *why* a divergence from the Python
reference exists is what makes that divergence reviewable, and reviewers reach for those sentences when
deciding whether code is right. That is what makes them load-bearing, and it is also what makes them
dangerous: nothing checks them, and they rot silently when the code beside them moves.

Two separate failures live here, and they need different instruments.

**Claims go stale.** Eight false claims were produced in two lots on 2026-08-13 alone, none caught by a
tool. Four more came from #127, four from #140 and #121, three predate the issue.

**Prose has crowded out code.** Measured across `src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `bench/` and `samples/`, over
**C# files only**: **1837 comment blocks, 9803 lines**, of which 354 run over eight lines — 19% of the
blocks, holding **5532 lines, 56% of all the prose**. One block in five carries more than half the text.
The longest is 63 lines.

Counting the Python under `tools/` and `bench/` as well, which is what the guard does, and applying both
budgets — two lines for an inline block, eight lines of prose for documentation — **629 blocks are past
budget, holding 5586 prose lines**. The block and line totals move with every commit, so
`python3 tools/check_comment_length.py --report` is the live figure rather than a number frozen here; it
read 2065 blocks and 10 616 lines when the budgets were set.

Splitting the 354 by kind is what set those budgets: **316 were pure XML documentation** (5017 lines) and
only 38 were inline. A single eight-line cap would therefore have been, at 89%, a cap on documenting the
public API — which `CLAUDE.md` separately requires. Excluding structural elements and tightening inline to
two lines puts the work where the prose actually is. The first figures are the ones quoted throughout this spec; the second is
the population the guard actually refuses, and the two were reconciled rather than averaged — the gap is
228 Python blocks, not drift.

## What is measured

### D1 — the rule this repository is said to have does not exist

The issue's own opening sentence asserts that `CONTRIBUTING.md` says a wrong claim in a comment is a
defect. It does not. `CONTRIBUTING.md` mentions comments four times — a reason above a `#pragma`, a comment
naming each `NoWarn`ed rule, a divergence belonging in `docs/decisions/` rather than a comment alone, and
an analyzer finding being a compile error rather than a pull-request comment. None states the rule. Neither
does `CLAUDE.md`, any ADR, or any guide.

**So the first step is writing the rule, not enforcing it.**

### D2 — re-reading a claim confirms it; only derivation breaks it

This is the finding that invalidates the fix the issue first proposed. On 2026-08-13, in #140, a false
claim **survived two reviews that were both looking at it**: a task reviewer wrote it, an implementer
transcribed it, and the whole-branch reviewer caught it only because it re-derived the shape from scratch
rather than reading the sentence.

The same pattern holds across every case with a known provenance. Of the eight from 2026-08-13:

| how it fell | count |
| --- | --- |
| someone re-derived the claim independently (ran it, re-implemented it, recounted it) | 6 |
| a differential against an independently written reference | 1 |
| an agent blocked by a criterion that contradicted the measurement | 1 |
| **someone read the sentence carefully** | **0** |

A review step that asks "is this comment still true?" buys the appearance of a check. The instruction has
to ask **what would you run to check it, and did you run it** — and where the claim is executable, to run
it and paste the output.

### D3 — the length problem is mechanisable, and the truth problem is not

| C# only | blocks | lines | share of prose |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| all comment blocks | 1837 | 9803 | 100% |
| blocks over 8 lines | 354 | 5532 | **56%** |
| **including Python** | **2065** | **10 616** | — |
| past budget, both kinds | 629 | 5586 prose | — |

The ten longest run 35 to 63 lines. `src/DataNet.Embeddings/Tokenization/BpeTokenizer.cs` holds three of
them; `TokenizerJsonLoader.cs:7` holds the longest.

Counting a block's lines is exact and cheap, which makes it a `Lint` job in the shape
`tools/check_machine_paths.py` established for #133. Deciding whether a sentence is true is not, which is
why the two halves of this lot use different instruments and why neither substitutes for the other.

### D4 — the long explanations already have a home

`CLAUDE.md` requires a deliberate divergence from the Python reference to go in `docs/decisions/`. A
63-line comment is an ADR that was never written. The 5532 lines are therefore not waste to delete but
prose in the wrong place: it belongs where someone goes to understand a decision, not where someone is
trying to read code.

### D5 — nine claims in ten cite nothing

504 comment lines across the tracked tree name a reference library. **46 of them — 9% — carry a pointer to
anything that would check them**: a corpus file, an oracle case, a measurement, an ADR, an issue.

| zone | claims | citing evidence |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `src/DataNet.Metrics` | 162 | 2 |
| `src/DataNet.Embeddings` | 113 | 12 |
| `src/DataNet.Text` | 76 | 3 |
| `tests/DataNet.Embeddings.Tests` | 42 | 7 |
| `tests/DataNet.Metrics.Tests` | 35 | 6 |
| `tools/generate_oracles.py` | 28 | 10 |
| `samples/`, `bench/`, the rest | 48 | 6 |

That distribution is what orders the sweep, and it also says what the sweep can honestly be. **Nobody can
re-derive 504 claims by hand**, and a sweep that said it had would be the most expensive false claim in
this issue. What it can do is make each one checkable or make it go away.

## Design

### The rule, in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

A new section beside `Performance claims`, which is the precedent — this repository already governs one
class of claim by requiring its evidence, and ends that section with the same principle this lot
generalises: *"Verify what you are actually measuring before quoting a result."*

Four rules, stated once:

1. **A comment says why, never what.** Paraphrasing the line below it is noise that goes stale faster than
   the code does.
2. **A claim carries what would check it.** Where the claim is executable — a measurement, a reference
   library's output, a count — run it and cite the output or the corpus case. "Measured" without a pointer
   is an assertion.
3. **Two budgets, because the two kinds of prose sit in different places.** An inline comment stands
   between a reader and the code, so it gets **two lines** — a sentence, not a paragraph. XML documentation
   is the member's own interface, read by a caller who does not have the source and required on every
   public member by `CLAUDE.md`, so it gets **eight**, counted over prose: a `<param>` or an `<exception>`
   a well-formed member must carry does not spend the budget. Beyond either, the reasoning belongs in
   `docs/decisions/`, cited from one line — or it needs cutting.
4. **A block over eight lines carries a marker naming its reason**, in the shape every other exemption in
   this repository takes.

**Scope: every tracked file, including `docs/superpowers/`.** A spec that overclaims what its corpus proves
is the same defect; #119's and #130's did exactly that, and both were caught by an implementer refusing to
proceed, which is not a process.

`CLAUDE.md` gains a pointer to the section, since that is what agents read.

### The derivation step, in `.github/instructions/`

`.github/instructions/sonarqube_mcp.instructions.md` is this repository's only durable instruction file
that review flows cite, and `CLAUDE.md` names it. A new sibling carries the review step, because a rule
that lives only in a session's dispatch prompt does not survive that session.

It states the trigger and the question:

- **Trigger:** every comment the diff **modifies or moves**. Moves matter: three of the eight 2026-08-13
  failures were one sentence corrected in one place and left standing in its copy.
- **Question:** not "is this true", which re-reading answers yes to (D2), but "what would you run, and did
  you run it" — and for a reviewer, derive it independently rather than checking the author's reasoning.
- **A marker is a claim too, and the review judges it.** The guard can only see that a marker exists; only
  a reader can see whether the block deserved one. So a length marker in the diff is reviewed like any
  other exemption in this repository — against the same bar `#pragma warning disable` is held to, where
  "too noisy" is explicitly not a reason. A block that could have been eight lines, or whose reasoning
  belonged in an ADR, is a finding even though the guard passed it.

### The length guard, in `Lint`

`tools/check_comment_length.py`, on the pattern `check_machine_paths.py` established: standard library
only, `git ls-files`-scoped, a docstring naming the drift it catches, invoked from CI.

It counts consecutive comment lines and refuses a block over eight that carries no marker. **The marker is
what keeps this from being a ban**: longer is allowed where it is necessary, and the marker plus its reason
is what stops it becoming the norm — the same bargain `#pragma warning disable` strikes. The guard also
reports the marker count, so growth is visible rather than gradual.

**It cannot be switched on before the 354 blocks are dealt with**, which is why the sweep is in this
lot rather than after it, and why the guard lands last.

### The sweep, and what it can honestly claim

The 354 over-length blocks and the 504 claims are in scope, and the guard cannot be switched on until the
blocks are dealt with — that ordering is what makes them one lot rather than two.

**Its product is not "504 claims verified".** It is: every claim either carries a pointer to what would
check it, or no longer exists. Each is triaged into one of three, and the triage is the work:

1. **A corpus already answers it.** Cite the file and the case. This is the cheap tier and it is why the
   sweep starts where the corpora are thickest.
2. **It is executable but nothing frozen answers it.** Run it once and cite the output — or, where the
   answer deserves freezing, add the corpus case and cite that instead.
3. **Nothing reasonable checks it.** Then it is an opinion wearing a measurement's clothes, and it gets
   cut or rewritten as the opinion it is. A comment that cannot be checked is not thereby exempt; it is
   thereby not a claim.

The same pass handles the block that sits around it: over eight lines, it is cut, moved to an ADR and cited
from one line, or marked with its reason.

**Order, from D5's distribution:** `src/DataNet.Metrics` with `tests/DataNet.Metrics.Tests` first — the
most claims, the fewest citations, and oracle corpora that make tier 1 nearly free. Then
`src/DataNet.Embeddings` with its tests, then `src/DataNet.Text`, then `tools/generate_oracles.py`, then
`bench/` and `samples/`. Each is its own plan; the guard is switched on by the last of them.

`tests/` is not the lesser half. A comment in `src/` asserts what the reference does; a comment in `tests/`
asserts **what the corpus proves**, which is the evidence a reviewer reaches for when judging everything
else. `tools/generate_oracles.py`'s 28 are the same shape one step earlier — they explain why a corpus
contains what it contains, and they are read by whoever regenerates it.

### The prose documents, read against each other

`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `docs/equivalence.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/guides/` are in scope for the
same reason the comments are: they assert things, they were written at different times, and nothing checks
that they still agree. A duplicated paragraph is where a correction lands in one copy and not the other —
which is how three of the eight 2026-08-13 failures happened, inside single documents.

This pass looks for three things, and they need different fixes:

- **A statement in two places.** One of them is the home; the other becomes a pointer. Which is which is
  decided by where a reader would look first, not by which was written first.
- **Two statements that disagree.** Measure which is true before choosing — a contradiction resolved by
  preferring the newer sentence is a coin toss with extra steps.
- **A statement that was true and is not.** The same defect as a stale comment, in a file the build never
  reads.

`docs/decisions/` is included, and the sweep will have added to it: an ADR contradicting a newer one is
worse than a stale comment, because ADRs are what the repository consults to settle exactly that kind of
question.

## Evidence

`tools/tests/test_check_comment_length.py`, beside the existing guard tests that CI already runs through
`python -m pytest tools/tests -q`. Its fixtures are **real blocks from this repository**, recovered from
the measured list — the 63-line one, a nine-line one just over the threshold, an eight-line one just under,
a marked block, and a block interrupted by a blank line, which is where a naive counter is wrong.

The rule's own text is checked by the thing it describes: this spec and its plan are inside the scope it
declares.

## What this lot delivers, and what it hands on

The rule and its instruments ship here. The sweep does not, and that is a decision taken after measuring
it rather than a scope guessed at the start.

**Delivered:**

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` states the rule; `CLAUDE.md` points at it; `.github/instructions/` carries the review
  step, phrased as derivation rather than re-reading because re-reading was measured not to work (D2).
- `tools/check_comment_length.py` counts both budgets, refuses an unmarked block past its own, refuses a
  marker with no reason, and reports. 67 tests in `tools/tests`.
- **The inventory**, which is the part that makes the rest schedulable: `--report` gives the live total,
  and a bare run names every block with its file, line and prose count.

**Handed on**, one issue per zone, sized from that run:

| zone | blocks past budget |
| --- | ---: |
| `src/DataNet.Embeddings` | 126 |
| `src/DataNet.Metrics` | 98 |
| `tools/` | 82 |
| `tests/DataNet.Metrics.Tests` | 77 |
| `tests/DataNet.Embeddings.Tests` | 70 |
| `src/DataNet.Text` | 70 |
| `samples/`, `tools/tests/` | 41 |

629 blocks holding 5586 prose lines, plus the 504 comment lines naming a reference library of which 46
cite anything. Each zone also carries its share of those.

**The guard is not wired into CI**, and cannot be until a zone passes it. Wiring it is the last of those
issues, not this lot's to claim.

**Why split it here.** Each block needs a judgement — paraphrase to cut, reasoning to move to an ADR, or
room genuinely earned and marked — and doing 629 of them quickly is how the 5586 lines of measured
reasoning get destroyed rather than relocated. A rule that holds, with a counter that says exactly how much
is left, is worth more than a sweep nobody can tell the end of.

## Out of scope

**Automating truth.** No tool decides whether a sentence is true. The guard counts lines; the review step
asks for derivation. Anything claiming to do more would be the third instrument this lot does not have.

## Risks

- **A marker becomes a rubber stamp.** This is the likeliest failure, because the guard passes a marked
  block whatever its reason says. Two things push back and neither is complete: the review step judges the
  marker's legitimacy explicitly, held to the bar `#pragma warning disable` is held to, where "too noisy"
  is not a reason; and the guard reports the marker count, so the norm drifting is visible rather than
  gradual. Nothing makes it impossible.
- **Eight is a round number.** It was chosen rather than measured, and the distribution does not argue for
  a different one — 80% of blocks already fit. If it proves wrong the constant is in one place, and the
  marker means being wrong costs a marker rather than a deletion.
- **The derivation step costs review time**, and it is the expensive half. The bound is the diff, not the
  repository, and D2's count is the argument for paying it: six of eight failures needed something
  executed, and none was caught by reading.
