# EmbeddingIndex.Load

Reads an index back, ready to search without embedding the corpus again.

<!-- docs-declaration -->

```csharp
public static EmbeddingIndex Load(Stream source, ArtifactLoadOptions options = null)
public static EmbeddingIndex Load(string path, ArtifactLoadOptions options = null)
public static EmbeddingIndex Load(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> artifact, ArtifactLoadOptions options = null)
```

**Parameters** — `source` is a readable stream, left open for the caller to dispose; `path` is the
file to read; `artifact` is the bytes themselves. `options` bounds what will be accepted and
defaults to [`ArtifactLoadOptions`](../persistence/artifactloadoptions.md)'s own defaults.

**Returns** — `EmbeddingIndex`, with the same `Dimension`, `Count`, ids and normalization setting
it was saved with.

**Exceptions** — `ArgumentNullException` when `source` or `path` is null. `InvalidDataException` when the content is not an embedding index, is of an
unsupported version, is internally inconsistent, holds a non-finite value, or exceeds a bound in
`options`. `FileNotFoundException` when `path` names no file, and `IOException` when it cannot be
opened or read.

**Example** — a saved index reloaded and queried.

```csharp
using Lodestar.Embeddings.Search;

var original = new EmbeddingIndex(dimension: 2);
original.Add(new float[] { 1f, 0f }, "east");
original.Add(new float[] { 0f, 1f }, "north");

using var buffer = new MemoryStream();
original.Save(buffer);
buffer.Position = 0;

EmbeddingIndex reloaded = EmbeddingIndex.Load(buffer);
int size = reloaded.Count;  // => 2
string top = reloaded.GetId(reloaded.Search(new float[] { 1f, 0f }, k: 1)[0].Index)!;  // => east

EmbeddingIndex fromBytes = EmbeddingIndex.Load(buffer.ToArray().AsMemory());
int same = fromBytes.Count;  // => 2
```

**Which overload** — take the one that matches what you have, and prefer not to convert. A
`Stream` has to be copied into one buffer before anything is parsed, which is about a third of a
large index's load; the `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` overload parses the caller's own bytes in place, so
wrapping a `byte[]` in a `MemoryStream` to reach the stream overload pays for a copy that had no
reason to exist. Reading from disk or from a network response, the stream overloads are the ones
that fit; holding a database blob, a cache entry or an embedded resource, the memory one is.

**The bytes must not change while the memory overload runs** — it reads them rather than a copy of
them. And it has no `Async` counterpart, deliberately: there is nothing to wait for when the bytes
are already in hand. It also checks `MaxTotalBytes` **before** parsing anything, the length being
known up front, where the stream overloads can only check it as they read.

**Only `EmbeddingIndex` has this overload**, and that is measured rather than an oversight. What it
saves is a copy, so it scales with the artifact, and no other artifact this library loads is large
enough for it to register — a fitted vectorizer's buffers never even reach the large-object heap.

**Remarks** — vectors are restored **exactly as stored** and never replayed through
[`Add`](embeddingindex-add.md). Re-normalizing an already normalized vector would move its bits,
and a reloaded index would then score slightly differently from the one that was saved.

**The normalization flag travels in the file and cannot be supplied here.** That is why neither
overload takes one. An index built with normalization on and reloaded with it off would rank a
corpus wrongly while looking entirely healthy, which is the class of bug a file format should make
impossible rather than document.

`options` is what stands between a file and an allocation. The vector `count` and the id array
are bounded by `MaxArrayLength` before they size anything, and the vector block is capped in
**bytes** by `MaxTotalBytes` before parsing begins — an element-count limit sized for a vocabulary
is orders of magnitude away from what a corpus of embeddings needs. **An index past 1,000,000
vectors therefore saves but needs a raised `MaxArrayLength` to load.** A file that exceeds a bound is refused, never truncated: a quietly smaller index
is a wrong answer. Past one array, about 2 GB, a stream is read in segments, whether it declares its
length or not ([#377](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/lodestar/issues/377),
[#1618](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/lodestar/issues/1618)).

Internal consistency is checked too. A file whose `count` and `dimension` do not account for the
number of values in its vector block is refused, as is one whose id array is a different length
from its count.

**Applies to** — net10.0, netstandard2.0.
