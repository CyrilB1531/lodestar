# HashingVectorizer

Counts into a fixed number of columns, learning nothing — the equivalent of
`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer`.

Each term is hashed to a column. There is no vocabulary, so there is no `Fit`, no memory that
grows with the corpus, and **no `GetFeatureNames`**: nothing was kept that could name a column.

<!-- docs-declaration -->

```csharp
public sealed class HashingVectorizer
```

**Constructor** — `HashingVectorizer(HashingVectorizerOptions? options = null)`, whose defaults
are scikit-learn's. It throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when `NumFeatures` is below `1`, and
`ArgumentException` when `Count.NgramRange` descends, the one range scikit-learn refuses too.

**Properties** — `NumFeatures` is how many columns the matrix has.

**Example** — no fitting, and a width chosen rather than discovered.

```csharp
using Lodestar.Abstractions;
using Lodestar.Text.Vectorization;

var hv = new HashingVectorizer(new HashingVectorizerOptions { NumFeatures = 16 });
CsrMatrix hashed = hv.Transform(["the cat eats", "the dog eats", "the cat and the dog"]);

int columns = hashed.ColumnCount;  // => 16
double rowLength = hashed.RowL2Norm(0);  // => 1
```

**Remarks** — the trade is stateless-ness for names and for collisions. Choose this when the
corpus is a stream too large to pass over twice, when documents arrive one at a time and the
vocabulary would grow without bound, or when several machines must produce compatible vectors
without sharing a fitted model — hashing is deterministic, so they will.

Do not choose it when you will need to explain a vector. Column 9 means "whatever hashed to 9",
possibly two unrelated terms at once, and there is no way back.

`AlternateSign` is what keeps collisions from simply accumulating; see
[`HashingVectorizerOptions`](hashingvectorizeroptions.md).

**Applies to** — net10.0, netstandard2.0.
