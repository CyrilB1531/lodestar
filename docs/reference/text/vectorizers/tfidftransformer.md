# TfidfTransformer

Counts in, TF-IDF weights out — the equivalent of
`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer`.

Takes a [`CsrMatrix`](../../abstractions/sparse/csrmatrix.md) of counts from anywhere and reweights it, so a term appearing
in every document counts for little and one appearing in a few counts for a lot.

<!-- docs-declaration -->

```csharp
public sealed class TfidfTransformer
```

**Constructor** — `TfidfTransformer(TfidfOptions? options = null)`, whose defaults are
scikit-learn's.

**Properties** — `Idf` is the inverse document frequency learned per column, computed by fitting
whether or not [`TfidfOptions.UseIdf`](tfidfoptions.md) is set; reading it before fitting throws `InvalidOperationException`.

**Example** — counts from a [`CountVectorizer`](countvectorizer.md), weighted afterwards.

```csharp
using Lodestar.Abstractions;
using Lodestar.Text.Vectorization;

string[] docs = ["the cat eats", "the dog eats", "the cat and the dog"];
CsrMatrix counts = new CountVectorizer().FitTransform(docs);

CsrMatrix weighted = new TfidfTransformer().FitTransform(counts);

double rowLength = weighted.RowL2Norm(0);  // => 1
```

**Remarks** — this exists separately from [`TfidfVectorizer`](tfidfvectorizer.md) because counts
do not have to come from text. A matrix built by hand, loaded from a file, or produced by another
library can be weighted here, and that is the case the combined vectorizer cannot serve.

Where the counts *do* come from text, [`TfidfVectorizer`](tfidfvectorizer.md) is this and a
[`CountVectorizer`](countvectorizer.md) in one pass, and is the shorter path.

**Applies to** — net10.0, netstandard2.0.

**See also** — [`TfidfOptions`](tfidfoptions.md), [`TfidfVectorizer`](tfidfvectorizer.md),
[`CsrMatrix`](../../abstractions/sparse/csrmatrix.md), the [Python equivalence table](../../../equivalence.md).
