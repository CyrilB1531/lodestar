# Rake

Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction: candidates are the runs between stop words, scored by summing
a per-word score over the run.

<!-- docs-declaration -->

```csharp
public sealed class Rake
```

**Example** — the paper's own worked sentence, with a small stop-word list standing in for
`StopWords.English`. Two candidates tie at the top score, and the tie breaks by phrase
descending, rake-nltk's own rule — "natural numbers" before "linear constraints", not the order
either one occurs in the source.

```csharp
using Lodestar.Text.Keywords;

string[] stop = ["of", "the", "over", "a", "and", "are", "for", "all", "to", "in", "is", "this", "that"];
var rake = new Rake(new RakeOptions { StopWords = stop });

var hits = rake.Extract("Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers.");
string top = hits[0].Phrase;   // => natural numbers
double score = hits[0].Score;  // => 4
```

**Remarks** — the constructor is `Rake(RakeOptions? options = null)`; `null` takes every default,
which is `StopWords.English` for the stop-word list. It throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when
`options.MinLength` is below `1`, and `ArgumentException` when `options.MaxLength` is below
`options.MinLength` — a range no candidate could ever satisfy.

The co-occurrence tables — degree and frequency — are built once, over every surviving run, before
any candidate is scored. That ordering is what makes `IncludeRepeatedPhrases = false` change a
score and not only the output: dropping the duplicate before the tables are built removes its
contribution to degree and frequency too, not merely its second row in the result ([decision 0005](../../../decisions/0005-the-proof-standard-and-the-oracle-each-family-is-frozen-from.md)).
