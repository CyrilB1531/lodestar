# 0064 — `check_repeated_literals.py` runs in CI only, not the pre-commit hook

**Status:** accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-31

## Context

[Decision 0037](0037-the-guards-run-before-the-commit.md) put CI's offline guards in the
pre-commit hook, and `tools/tests/test_pre_commit_hook.py` holds the two spellings to each other:
every `tools/check_*.py` the workflows run must appear in `.githooks/pre-commit` too, unless it is
named in that test's `OFFLINE_EXCLUSIONS` with a reason.

Two guards are excluded today. `check_nuspec_dependencies.py` reads the `.nuspec` files inside a
packed `./artifacts`, so running it before a commit would mean packing four projects first — 0037
named it. `check_adr_immutable.py` needs `--base`, and a commit made before a pull request exists
has no base to name; [decision 0046](0046-check-adr-immutable-runs-in-ci-only.md) recorded that as
a decision of its own rather than an edit to 0037, which is what 0046 exists to enforce.

`check_repeated_literals.py`, added for [#489](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/lodestar/issues/489),
is the third. It asks before the push the question SonarCloud's S1192 asks after it, and it takes
`--base` for the same reason 0046's guard does.

## Decision

**It is excluded from the hook, for `check_adr_immutable.py`'s reason and one of its own.**

The shared reason is `--base`. A pre-commit hook runs with no pull request and therefore no base
commit; passing it `origin/main` instead would compare against whatever that ref happens to point
at locally, which on a stale clone is neither the branch point nor the merge target.

The reason of its own is what the check reports. `tools/generate_oracles.py` already holds some
108 literals over S1192's threshold, mostly JSON keys like `"metadata"` and `"count"`. The quality
gate tolerates them because only new code counts, and this guard is only useful for the same
reason: it reports what a change *adds*, which it can only know from a base. A hook printing 108
standing findings on every commit would be turned off within a day — the outcome 0037 exists to
prevent.

The threshold itself is measured rather than assumed. On
[#488](https://github.com/CyrilB1531/lodestar/pull/488) the gate raised exactly one issue: a
literal new to the file at four occurrences. Three others sat at three and two more crossed from
three to four or five, and none of those was raised — so S1192 fires *past* three, and it anchors
its issue on the literal's first occurrence, which has to be new code for the issue to be new. The
guard applies both halves, and reproduces that pull request's answer on both sides of its fix.

Recorded here rather than as an edit to 0037 or 0046, both accepted and immutable, per the rule
0046 itself was written to enforce.

## Consequences

`OFFLINE_EXCLUSIONS` gains a third name, and `test_the_hook_runs_every_offline_guard_ci_runs`
keeps holding the two spellings together for every other guard.

A contributor who wants the answer before pushing runs it by hand —
`python3 tools/check_repeated_literals.py --base origin/main`, which `CLAUDE.md`'s command list
carries — and `--report` prints the standing backlog without failing, for whoever wants to see it
rather than be blocked by it.

This does not weaken 0037. The rule there is that a guard which *can* run offline before a commit
does; this one cannot answer its question without a base, and answering it wrongly is worse than
leaving it to the pull request.
