# Third-party notices

This file records attributions for third-party components. Per §10.3 of the
project brief, every shipped dependency is listed here with its license.
Build-time and development-only tools — used to compile or to *generate* test
data, but never linked into the distributed libraries — are recorded separately
for traceability.

## Runtime / shipped dependencies

`Lodestar.Text`, `Lodestar.Fuzzy` and `Lodestar.Metrics` have **no** runtime
dependencies on `net10.0`, by design (§3).

| Component | License | Shipped by | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime | MIT | `Lodestar.Embeddings` | both |
| System.Memory | MIT | all four packages | `netstandard2.0` only |
| System.Numerics.Vectors | MIT | all four packages | `netstandard2.0` only |
| System.Text.Json | MIT | `Lodestar.Text`, `Lodestar.Embeddings` | `netstandard2.0` only |

`System.Memory` and `System.Numerics.Vectors` supply `Span`, `Memory`,
`ArrayPool` and `Vector<T>`, which are in-box on `net10.0`. They appear only in
the `netstandard2.0` dependency group of each package.

`System.Text.Json` is likewise in-box from `net8.0` onwards, and appears only in
the `netstandard2.0` group. It backs the persistence layer — saving a fitted
vectorizer, reading a `tokenizer.json` — and is the one place the "no external
dependencies" rule is knowingly bent rather than a polyfill for something the
modern framework already provides. `Lodestar.Fuzzy` ships no I/O and does not
take it. The reasoning is in
[`docs/decisions/0011-persistence-format.md`](docs/decisions/0011-persistence-format.md).

ONNX Runtime is deliberately isolated to `Lodestar.Embeddings`, so consumers of
the distance, vectorization and fuzzy-matching packages take no native
dependency.

## Redistributed resources (shipped inside the assemblies)

| Component | License | Shipped by | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Snowball stop-word lists (fr, de, it, pt, es) | BSD-3-Clause | `Lodestar.Text` | `https://snowballstem.org/algorithms/<language>/stop.txt` |

These are data, not code: the five lists are compiled into
`Lodestar.Text.Vectorization.StopWords` by `tools/fetch_stopwords.py`, which pins a
SHA-256 per file. Unlike the libraries below, they *are* redistributed, so the
licence travels with them. The English list is scikit-learn's (BSD-3-Clause), not
Snowball's; the nltk stop-word corpus is deliberately not used — see
[`docs/decisions/0010-stop-word-list-provenance.md`](docs/decisions/0010-stop-word-list-provenance.md).

## Redistributed test fixtures (not shipped)

| Component | License | Used by | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xlm-roberta-base` SentencePiece vocabulary | MIT | `tests/oracles/xlmr_fairseq.model` | `https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base/resolve/main/sentencepiece.bpe.model` |
| `gpt2` byte-level BPE vocabulary and merge table | MIT | `tests/oracles/gpt2_vocab.json`, `tests/oracles/gpt2_merges.txt` | `https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2/resolve/main/vocab.json`, `.../merges.txt` |
| `Mistral-7B-v0.1` SentencePiece-BPE vocabulary and merge table | Apache-2.0 | `tests/oracles/mistral_v01_tokenizer.json` | `https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1/resolve/main/tokenizer.json` |

The **vocabulary only** — the 250 000 pieces, their scores, their types and the
`nmt_nfkc` character map the file's `normalizer_spec` carries (a table compiled
by `sentencepiece`, Apache-2.0, from Unicode data). No model weights are
redistributed, per
[`docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md`](docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md).
The file is compiled into no package: it lives under `tests/`, is copied to the
test output, and exists so the tokenizer's parity claim is checked against a real
multilingual vocabulary in the layout HuggingFace uses. It is re-emitted from the
upstream download by `tools/fetch_xlmr_vocab.py`, which pins the upstream
SHA-256; the reasoning is in
[`docs/decisions/0013-sentencepiece-parity-scope.md`](docs/decisions/0013-sentencepiece-parity-scope.md).

The **vocabulary and merge table only** — the 50 257 token-to-id entries of
`gpt2_vocab.json` and the ranked merge pairs of `gpt2_merges.txt`, in the exact
`merges.txt` layout GPT-2 ships. No model weights are redistributed, per
[`docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md`](docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md).
The files are compiled into no package: they live under `tests/`, are copied to
the test output, and exist so `ByteLevelBpeTests`' claim of byte-exact parity
with HuggingFace `tokenizers` is checked against GPT-2's real 50 257-entry
vocabulary. A self-trained toy model could never exercise a merge table with
50 000 ranks. They are downloaded verbatim by `tools/fetch_gpt2_bpe.py`, which
pins the upstream SHA-256 of each file.

### `Mistral-7B-v0.1` tokenizer

The **vocabulary and merge table only** — the 32 000 entries and 58 980 ranked
pairs of `tokenizer.json`, with the `Metaspace` pre-tokenizer and `byte_fallback`
flags that make it the SentencePiece-BPE lineage. No model weights are
redistributed, per
[`docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md`](docs/decisions/0003-provenance-and-licensing.md).

The file is compiled into no package: it lives under `tests/`, is copied to the
test output, and exists so `SentencePieceBpeLineageOracleTests` checks the
whitespace escape and the byte fallback against a file a user actually has,
rather than a synthetic model built from this project's own understanding of the
format. It is downloaded verbatim by
`tools/fetch_llama2_mistral_tokenizers.py`, which pins its upstream SHA-256 and
corroborates it against a second mirror.

**Llama-2 is deliberately absent.** Its gated original is `license:llama2` — the
Llama 2 Community License, which is not one of the permissive licenses decision
0003 names — and both ungated mirrors declare no license at all. The fetch tool
downloads and verifies it so the claim stays reproducible, and writes nothing.
Issue #552 holds that decision.

## Build-time dependencies (not shipped)

| Component | License | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PolySharp | MIT | Compile-time polyfills for the `netstandard2.0` target. `PrivateAssets="all"`, so it emits source and adds no package dependency. |

## Test and benchmark dependencies (not shipped)

| Component | License | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xUnit | Apache-2.0 | Test framework (`tests/`) |
| coverlet.collector | MIT | Code coverage collection (`tests/`) |
| BenchmarkDotNet | MIT | Micro-benchmarks (`bench/`) |

## Development-only oracle generation (not distributed)

These libraries are executed by `tools/generate_oracles.py` to produce the
reference JSON committed under `tests/oracles/`. They are **not** dependencies of
the shipped libraries, and are **not** transcribed — only their observable
input/output behavior is reproduced (permitted per §10.2). Running a program to
generate test data creates no license claim over the output.
