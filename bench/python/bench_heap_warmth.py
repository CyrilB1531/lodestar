"""np.load in a process that has called np.save, against one that has not.

The C# counterpart is HeapWarmthBench, and this mirrors its shape rather than its
code: three subcommands, because the variable under test is the process. `prepare`
writes the .npy once, `cold` loads those bytes having built and saved nothing, and
`warm` does its saves first and then loads.

The question is #433's second half. If numpy has no such asymmetry and C# does, the
published embedding_index_load ratio flatters us, and #324's "furthest behind"
framing is understated rather than overstated. Either ordering is a result here.
