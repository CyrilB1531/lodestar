"""Time the Python counterparts of the Lodestar persistence work.

Methodology is mirrored by the C# harness (bench/Lodestar.Text.Benchmarks,
`compare-persistence` mode) so the two are comparable:

  * same corpus files (bench/corpus/vocabs/),
  * metric: milliseconds per operation,
  * auto-scaling: repeat until a measurement lasts >= MIN_TIME,
  * report the best (minimum) of REPEATS measurements.

Note what the two sides each build. tokenizers and sentencepiece construct a
whole tokenizer -- the normalizer and pre-tokenizer graph, the Rust or C++
matcher it will encode with. Lodestar's loaders build a validated dictionary and
stop; the guides tell readers to construct a tokenizer from it as a second step.
A margin in Lodestar's favour therefore reflects, in part, work it does not do.
