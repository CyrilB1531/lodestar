"""Refuse a public class with no sample of its own, package by package (#280).

Decision 0041 names a sample after the class it demonstrates, so a type without
one is a type nobody can find an example of. The packaging gate already refuses a
type the sample never *references*; it says nothing about which file that
reference lives in, which is what this adds.

Only the packages listed in CONVERTED are enforced. The rest still carry their
Lot* files and would fail every run until their own lot lands -- the same shape
docs/wiki-map.json's covered table uses, and the same reason: a gate that fails
on work nobody has started yet is noise a contributor learns to skip.

An enum is not a class and is excluded by decision 0041: it is demonstrated
through the class whose parameter it is, and a file exercising one alone would
have to invent a use for it.

Usage:  python tools/check_sample_coverage.py

Exit:   0 clean, 1 findings printed, 2 bad usage
