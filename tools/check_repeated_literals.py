"""Refuse a pull request that pushes a Python string literal past S1192's threshold.

SonarCloud's S1192 fires on a literal repeated three times or more in one file,
and it is reported only after the push: `AnalysisMode=All` covers this
repository's C# in the build, but nothing looks at its Python before the
quality gate does. tools/generate_oracles.py has tripped it repeatedly, most
recently on #559, where "naïve" reached a third occurrence and failed an
otherwise green pull request.

The file already holds some 108 literals past that threshold, mostly
JSON keys like "metadata" and "count". Reporting those would drown the signal,
and the gate itself tolerates them because only new code counts. So this script
compares against a base revision and reports a literal only when the change
takes it from under three occurrences to three or more.

What it deliberately does **not** require is that the literal's first occurrence
be on a line the change added. It did, between #488 and #560, on the reading that
S1192 anchors its issue there and only new code counts -- but the gate treats the
*issue* as new rather than its anchor. "naïve" crossed 2 -> 3 in #559 with its
first occurrence on a line nobody had edited, and was raised. That same reading
had also put the threshold at four, from one issue at four occurrences on #488
while three literals sat at three unreported; those three were already at three
before that change, so their issues were not new -- which this rule covers, and a
threshold of four does not.

A literal already over it and merely growing is not reported. That is the rule
this repository applies by hand anyway: META_SYMBOL, THE_CAT and BOS_TOKEN in
generate_oracles.py are literals that reached three uses and were given a name.
S1192 is why the question started being asked; the answer here is the naming
convention, which is why the threshold is stated once above rather than chased
against whatever the server's quality profile is set to this week.

Names it does not count: a literal shorter than MIN_LENGTH, which S1192 ignores
too; a docstring, which is documentation rather than a repeated constant; a
literal appearing once per file, which cannot be duplication; and anything under
tools/tests/, which sonar.exclusions already exempts.

Usage:  python tools/check_repeated_literals.py --base <commit>
        python tools/check_repeated_literals.py --report
        python tools/check_repeated_literals.py --help

  --base <commit>  What the pull request is compared against. Required for the
                    check: an implicit default would silently compare against
                    the wrong thing on a rebased or force-pushed branch.
  --report         Print every literal at or over the threshold in the working
                    tree, with its count, and exit 0. The standing backlog, for
                    a contributor who wants to see it rather than be blocked by
                    it.
  --help, -h       Print this message to stdout and exit 0.

Exit:   0 clean, 1 findings printed, 2 bad usage
