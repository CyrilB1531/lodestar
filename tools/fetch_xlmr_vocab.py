"""Rebuild tests/oracles/xlmr_fairseq.model from the XLM-R vocabulary.

XLM-R is one of the families `SentencePieceTokenizer` advertises, and the one
issue #63 was filed about: HuggingFace lays its vocabulary out as `<s>`=0,
`<pad>`=1, `</s>`=2, `<unk>`=3 and `<mask>` last, so a tokenizer that decides
what is a control piece from the id fails on it — silently, with a different
segmentation and therefore different embeddings.

The stock `sentencepiece.bpe.model` cannot serve as that fixture as it stands:
**its own layout is the raw one** — `<unk>`=0, `<s>`=1, `</s>`=2, no `<pad>`, no
`<mask>`. The fairseq numbering lives in the HuggingFace tokenizer wrapper, not
in the file, so the stock file exercises exactly the case the old id guess got
*right*.

So this script re-emits the vocabulary rather than copying it. The 250 000
pieces keep their strings, their scores and the ids HuggingFace gives them —
`XLMRobertaTokenizer` maps spm id `i` to `i + 1` for `i >= 3`, which is
reproduced here — while the four fairseq specials take 0-3 and `<mask>` takes
250001. Each special is typed `CONTROL` or `UNKNOWN`, so the file states what
they are instead of leaving it to be inferred.

The **`normalizer_spec` is copied across untouched**, `nmt_nfkc` and its 237 539
byte `precompiled_charsmap` included. It was overwritten with `identity` when
this script was written, because `SentencePieceModelLoader` refused anything
else; #75 removed that limitation, and decision 0005 asked for this to be
revisited the day it did. The fixture is now the stock XLM-R pipeline, with the
vocabulary relabelled — one transformation instead of two.

    python tools/fetch_xlmr_vocab.py           # rebuild
    python tools/fetch_xlmr_vocab.py --check   # verify the checked-in fixture

The download is checked against the SHA-256 pinned below before anything is
written. A mismatch means the upstream file changed: read the diff, update the
pin, regenerate the oracle in the same commit, and expect the ids in
`xlmr_fairseq.json` to move.

`xlm-roberta-base` is MIT-licensed (https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base).
Only the vocabulary is redistributed here — never the weights, per
docs/decisions/0002-provenance-and-the-allowed-references.md. The attribution is recorded in
