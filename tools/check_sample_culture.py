"""Fail when the sample can print a number in the contributor's culture.

The sample is the packaging gate: CI runs it on every pull request and a
contributor reads its output to see that a package works. String interpolation
formats through CurrentCulture, so `{value:F3}` printed 0,807 on a French
console and 0.807 on CI -- the same commit, two outputs, and nothing failing,
because the gate checks that every public type is reachable rather than what
the run said (#205).

CA1305 cannot catch this. It fires on an explicit ToString(string) and never on
an interpolated hole, at any AnalysisMode -- the gap is in the rule, not in the
configuration, so raising AnalysisLevel would not surface one of them.

Two things are checked, because neither covers the other:

  1. No interpolated hole carries a numeric format specifier. Those are the
     rewritable ones, and Inv.F3(...) is what they become.
  2. Program.cs still pins the thread culture. That covers what a syntactic
     scan cannot -- a bare {value} hole whose expression is a double, which
     reads exactly like a bare {count} hole whose expression is an int.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 bad usage or a tree that is not shaped as
expected.
