"""Turn a checkout into the wiki tree, per package and per version.

The pages live in docs/ because that is where markdownlint, the snippet
compiler and pull-request review reach them. This turns them into what a
reader sees: a flat file per page, named for its channel and version -- flat
because a GitHub wiki addresses a page by file name alone, with no directory
context, and two files sharing a base name silently collide (one shadows the
other with no warning).

docs/wiki-map.json is the only place that says which page belongs to which
package. A page listed there and absent from the tree is an error, not a
silence: that is how a renamed guide stops being published without anyone
noticing.

Links are rewritten from repository-relative paths to flat wiki names. A wiki
page has no .md suffix and no directory, so `../reference/text/distances.md`
read in a guide has to become `Text-distances` in the wiki or it 404s.

Each live channel also gets a generated entry page, `<channel>.md` -- `Text.md`
and so on -- linking to every namespace the package covers and every guide it
ships, so Home can send a reader one level down without naming a page that
might not exist. It carries no content of its own to freeze, so an archived
version does not get one: `<channel>-<version>-<stem>` already names every
frozen page a reader can reach from the banner, and the entry page's own name
has no stem to sit in that scheme -- inventing one would mean teaching
_archive_pattern, _live_stems and _archive_stems (which infer "archived" from
a trailing `-<stem>` after the version) to special-case a page that has none,
for a hub whose only content is links the frozen pages already carry to each
other via the banner. A reader who follows a banner back to an archived page
lands on that page's own frozen counterpart, never on an index, and that is
enough.

Usage:
    python3 tools/build_wiki.py --repo <dir> --out <dir>
        --released Lodestar.Text=0.3.0 [--released ...]
        [--archive Lodestar.Text=0.4.0]

Without --archive it refreshes every live channel and the root pages, each
named `<channel>-<stem>`. With it, it first freezes that one package under
`<channel>-<version>-<stem>` and then refreshes the live channels on top of
that copy: the sidebar's version list and the live pages' banner are both read
off the tree, so archiving alone would leave them naming the previous release.
