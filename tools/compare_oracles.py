"""Compare two directories of oracle corpora the way the test suites do.

The `Oracles are reproducible` gate used to regenerate the corpora on the
runner and `git diff --quiet` them. That asserts byte-identity, which is a
stronger property than anything the suites check and one no machine can hold:
the singular values in `decomposition_svd.json` disagree between hosts in
their twelfth significant digit (`-0.0026268786319` against
`-0.00262687863191`), while the suites compare at `1e-9` absolute. Rounding
cannot close that gap from either side -- at 12 significant digits the
disagreement is still in the last digit kept, and at 10 the rounding itself
breaks 13 tests (`1.13e-8` of error on a singular value of 22.606). So the
gate compares what the tests compare, and this is what does it.

Numerically means floats only. Everything else -- integers, strings,
booleans, nulls, the set and order of an object's keys, an array's length and
order, and the set of files -- is compared exactly, because a corpus that
gained a case, lost a field or reordered one has changed in a way no
floating-point unit can explain. A non-finite value is compared exactly too:
a tolerance around an infinity means nothing.

tools/compare_oracles.py records why the gate asserts this rather than byte-identity.

Usage:  python tools/compare_oracles.py <expected-dir> <actual-dir>
        python tools/compare_oracles.py --help

  <expected-dir>  The corpora as committed.
  <actual-dir>    The corpora as regenerated.
  --help, -h      Print this message to stdout and exit 0.

Exit:   0 clean, 1 differences printed, 2 bad usage
