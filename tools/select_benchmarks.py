"""Name the benchmark classes a range of commits makes worth re-running (#11).

The nightly run measures only what changed. It reads bench/bench-map.json, asks
git which files moved since the previous run, and prints the classes whose globs
those files match -- one per line, empty when nothing relevant moved.

Two deliberate biases, both toward running too much rather than too little:

  * an entry under "always" (src/Shared, the corpus, the harness entry point)
    selects every class, because a change there can move any measurement -- with
    one exception, "dispatch_only", where a file earns its place in "always" for
    one part of itself and the rest of it is a dispatch table nothing measures;
  * the globs are directory-wide, so a class runs whenever its neighbourhood
    moved. A benchmark run for nothing costs minutes; one not run hides a
    regression, and nothing goes red when it does.

The baseline commit is whatever the caller passes. The nightly reads it from the
page it published last time, so a run that never happened cannot silently narrow
the next one -- an absent baseline selects everything.

Usage:  python tools/select_benchmarks.py --since <commit> [--head <commit>]
        python tools/select_benchmarks.py --all

Exit:   0 always, unless the arguments or the map are unusable (2)
