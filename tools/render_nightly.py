"""Render the nightly benchmark page from what the run produced (#11).

The page is generated, published to the wiki, and never hand-edited. It carries
the baseline commit the next run reads, which is why it is a file in docs/ rather
than an artifact: the series has to remember where it stopped.

What it deliberately does NOT do is pretend to be docs/guides/performance.md.
That page's subject is what was measured on a named machine, and its numbers are
comparable to each other because the machine and its load are stated. A GitHub
hosted runner is a shared VM whose hardware differs between runs, so its absolute
figures are not comparable to that table nor, strictly, to last night's. What
survives is the ratio inside one run -- a baseline and its comparands measured in
the same minute on the same VM -- which is what this page is for.

Usage:  python tools/render_nightly.py --commit <sha> --baseline <sha> \\
            --runner <label> [--selected Class ...] [--reason text] [--branch] [--stdout]
