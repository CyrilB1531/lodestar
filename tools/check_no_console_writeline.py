"""Refuse a Console call in a shipped package, and an unexplained one in a bench.

`src/` is absolute: nothing under it prints. A library that writes to a console
its caller did not open is a library deciding for an application it cannot see,
and the packages here have never done it -- this guard exists so that stays true
by construction rather than by everyone remembering. There is no marker for
`src/`, because there is no reason that would survive review.

`bench/` is different, and the difference is what this guard is really about.
Ten Console calls there were a run narrating itself: banners, one line per
measured row, `-> path` after a file was written. None of them was in a timed
region and none changed a number, which is exactly why they accumulated -- each
was harmless, and nobody was counting. Four remain because each carries
something no file does: that the benchmark loaded the wrong build and its
results are meaningless, which assembly it did load, why a cell is missing from
a table, and the two group sizes without which a diagnostic class's own rows
cannot be read.

So a bench Console call needs a marker naming its reason, on its own line above
it or trailing the call:

    // console-print: says the wrong build was measured, or the run is a lie

An exemption list in this file would rot the way `check_machine_paths.py` says
they rot -- switched off a file at a time, by someone who is not the reviewer.
A marker rots in the diff that adds it, in front of the person who can refuse it.
This file's own `--report` output names the four marked calls and what each one carries.

Usage:  python tools/check_no_console_writeline.py [--report]

  --report  Print the marked calls and exit 0 without judging them.
