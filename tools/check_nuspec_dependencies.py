"""Assert the shipped NuGet dependency graph is exactly the intended one.

`dotnet pack` derives a package's ``<dependencies>`` from whatever the project
resolved at restore time, so the graph consumers see is a *build output*, not
something anyone wrote down. That makes it easy to change by accident: a
PackageReference added for a compile-time helper without ``PrivateAssets=all``
lands in it, and a dependency that quietly disappears is worse still — the
package installs and then fails at run time on a missing assembly.

The expected graph below is the written-down version. It is deliberately exact:
an unexpected dependency fails just as loudly as a missing one, and so does a
dependency whose declared version range has moved — an edge with the wrong floor
is a different edge, however right its id looks.

Usage:  python tools/check_nuspec_dependencies.py <artifacts-directory> [--require-all]

``--require-all`` additionally fails when a known package is absent, which is
what CI wants after packing all three. A release job packs exactly one package,
so it omits the flag.

``EXPECTED`` states the intended graph directly: ``Lodestar.Text`` carries
nothing on ``net10.0`` (the dependency-free core) and only
``System.Text.Json`` on ``netstandard2.0`` (the one deliberate exception, so
persisting a fitted model does not mean hand-rolling a JSON writer);
``Lodestar.Fuzzy`` depends on ``Lodestar.Text`` because ``Fuzz.Ratio`` is built
on ``Indel``, and since 0.5.0 ``Lodestar.Text`` depends on
``Lodestar.Abstractions`` because that is where ``CsrMatrix`` moved --
``Lodestar.Decomposition`` depends on ``Lodestar.Abstractions`` the same way,
for the same matrix -- and ``Lodestar.Onnx`` depends on ``Lodestar.Embeddings``
for the tokenizers and the pooling it feeds a session with: the four
inter-package edges that exist. The ranges are asserted too, not only the ids: a
bare ``"0.2.0"`` is NuGet's shorthand for ``[0.2.0, )``, and an edge with the
wrong floor is a different edge.

``Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime`` appears exactly once, under ``Lodestar.Onnx``. That
is the tier rule of #533 in assertable form: a core package carries no external
dependency, and this file is what fails when one reappears.
