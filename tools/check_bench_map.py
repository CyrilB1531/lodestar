"""Refuse a benchmark class that bench/bench-map.json does not know about.

The nightly run (#11) executes only the benchmark classes whose sources changed
since the previous run, and it reads bench/bench-map.json to decide which those
are. A class missing from that map is never selected, so it would stop being
measured without anything going red -- the same silence as a benchmark that
compiles and is never run, which is the gap #11 exists to close.

The map cannot be derived. FuzzBenchmarks names only Fuzz, which reaches Indel,
then Lcs, then Affixes; LevenshteinCodePointBenchmarks depends on the decoder in
Text/. Naming conventions do not carry that, so the map is hand-written and this
guard keeps it honest about the one thing it can check: completeness.

What it does NOT check is whether a class's globs are *right*. Being too narrow
is invisible here and is why the map is written at directory granularity: a
benchmark run for nothing costs minutes, one not run hides a regression.

Usage:  python tools/check_bench_map.py

Exit:   0 clean, 1 findings printed, 2 bad usage
