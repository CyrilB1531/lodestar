"""The interpreter floor this repository's generators require, in one place.

The floor is the interpreter CI runs, not the oldest one the syntax happens to
parse under. The corpora under ``tests/oracles/`` are these generators' output,
and the ``Oracles are reproducible`` job diffs them against a fresh generation,
so a contributor regenerating under an interpreter CI never runs would reach
that job as an unexplained drift on an unrelated change. tools/python_floor.py has the
option that lost.

``tools/tests/test_python_floor.py`` asserts that every ``python-version:`` pin
under ``.github/workflows/`` still equals the constant below: the refusal
message promises the floor is the CI interpreter, and a pin drifting away from
it would make that promise false.
