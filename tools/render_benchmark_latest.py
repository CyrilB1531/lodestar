"""Render the last known result for every benchmark, from the wiki's own history (#11).

nightly_run.md publishes only the classes a night's diff selected -- a class quiet for
weeks does not appear again until something near it moves. This walks the wiki repo's
own git log for that page (already a clone in the nightly job) and keeps, per section,
the newest occurrence: the last time each method was actually measured. Tonight's own
fresh reports, still on disk in this same job, take priority over that history -- run
alongside render_nightly.py rather than after its wiki push, so a class measured tonight
shows up tonight rather than waiting for tomorrow's aggregate to notice.

Numbers from different nights ran on different hosted-runner VMs and are not comparable
to each other any more than nightly_run.md's own numbers are comparable across nights --
this page exists to say "as of when", not to rank one method's history against another's.

Usage:  python tools/render_benchmark_latest.py --wiki <path to a lodestar.wiki.git clone>
            [--commit <sha>] [--max-commits N] [--branch] [--stdout]
