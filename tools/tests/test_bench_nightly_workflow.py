"""The nightly's permissions are keys GitHub accepts, and the publish runs no branch code.

Issue #464 was first fixed by asking for `workflows: write`. There is no such
permission scope: GitHub refused the whole file with "Unexpected value 'workflows'",
which takes a workflow out of service rather than failing one job. Decision 0067 has
the rest. The first test below is what would have caught it before the merge.
