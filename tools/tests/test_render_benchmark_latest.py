"""render_benchmark_latest.py's own tests: a page header is not a method's content.

nightly_run.md's own '## Against rapidfuzz, in this same run' header sits between
the report-github sections and the compare-* ones. Two methods whose latest
revisions differ -- the common case, since a night only remeasures what its own
diff touched -- each captured that header as trailing content of their own before
#356, and markdownlint's MD024 refused the result once two sections carried the
same sibling heading.
