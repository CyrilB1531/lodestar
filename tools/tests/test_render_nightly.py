"""render_nightly.py's own tests: two reports can carry the same stem.

MD024 has sunk this page once before, from a different cause -- #356, where a
page header was captured as one method's trailing content and two sections ended
up carrying the same sibling heading. This is the other way in: `included_reports`
emitted one `### {stem}` per path with nothing checking that a stem appears once,
so a class measured twice in a single run produced two byte-identical headings and
the whole lint job failed on them.

Numbering the later occurrence rather than dropping it is the deliberate half. The
second measurement is real data, it is almost certainly not wanted, and a reader
who can see it is the one who can go and remove whatever produced it.
